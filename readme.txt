Power up Postmatic with enhancements for multi-author blogs.

== Description ==
Postmatic is great for blog subscriptions, but did you know you can use it for author-only subscriptions as well? 

This plugin adds a suite of tweaks to Postmatic to better serve multi-author environments. It's a great fit for magazines and busy sites.

= What it does =

- The native Postmatic widget and Optins will modify their behavior on both single (post) and author archives. The title of the optin/widget will change to _Subscribe to new posts by Display Name_ and the subscription will be for that author only.
- Author information will be included in the title of the post when it is mailed out by Postmatic.

== Installation ==
1. Download the zip.
2. Extract the contents into your wp-content/plugins folder.
3. Activate.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need Postmatic to use this plugin? =
